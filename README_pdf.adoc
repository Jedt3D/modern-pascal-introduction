# How to get Pascal syntax highlighting with AsciiDoc in PDF

*Reasoning*: We use https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-fopub . It generates a nice PDF out-of-the-box, but it doesn't highlight Pascal keywords. That's because it uses _xslthl_ for syntax highlighting, and it seems that this version of xslthl doesn't include Pascal highlighter. I'm not sure is it a limitation of the _old version of xslthl 2.1.0_, or was it "cut down" when adjusting xslthl 2.1.0 to asciidoctor-fopub (as `asciidoctor-fopub/build/fopub/docbook-xsl/xslthl-config.xml` says _"Several of the lesser used languages have been removed."_)

The latest version of xslthl (see https://sourceforge.net/projects/xslthl/) does include a highlighter for Pascal (called "delphi"...). But simply upgrading xslthl version in `asciidoctor-fopub/build.gradle` doesn't work, it seems no version later than 2.1.0 works (it seems no new version was uploaded to "Maven Repository"?).

So, we make a hack:)

. Run `fopub` from `asciidoctor-fopub` at least once, to let it setup the `build` subdirectory. E.g. make once a PDF here, by `make clean all`.
. Get `delphi-hl.xml` file from https://sourceforge.net/p/xslthl/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/xslthl/highlighters/delphi-hl.xml . Drop it inside `.../asciidoctor-fopub/build/fopub/docbook-xsl/xslthl/` directory. Like this:
+
--
  cd ../asciidoctor-fopub/build/fopub/docbook-xsl/xslthl/
  wget http://svn.code.sf.net/p/xslthl/code/trunk/xslthl/highlighters/delphi-hl.xml
--
. Modify `.../asciidoctor-fopub/build/fopub/docbook-xsl/xslthl-config.xml` source code to add these lines:
+
--
  <highlighter id="pascal" file="./xslthl/delphi-hl.xml" />
  <highlighter id="delphi" file="./xslthl/delphi-hl.xml" />
--
+
Add them near the end, aligned with the rest of `<highlighter...` lines.

Works like a charm:) Now `[source,pascal]` inside `xxx.adoc` results in nice highlighting in PDF!
